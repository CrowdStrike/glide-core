'@crowdstrike/glide-core': patch
---

CSS variables were updated to align with the latest designs.

- Updated the color values for `--glide-core-icon-primary`, `--glide-core-surface-base-gray`, `--glide-core-surface-selected-disabled`, and `--glide-core-surface-unselected-disabled` to be more dark mode friendly.
- `--glide-core-border-radius-lg` was added.
