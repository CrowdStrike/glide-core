- Tag now supports a `color` attribute whose value can be `"green"`, `"indigo"`, or `"red"`. Tag's `removable` attribute and "icon" slot are unsupported when its `color` attribute is used.
- Tag now has a border.
- Tag's removal button is now larger.
- Tag's optional icon is now larger when `size="large"`.
