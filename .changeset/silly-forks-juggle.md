- Tab now updates the width of its selected indicator when a Tab's content changes.
- Tab's selected indicator now spans the full width of Tab.
- Tab Group no longer unnecessarily shows its overflow buttons when the content of a Tab is reduced.
- Tab Panel and Tab are now accessibly labeled and associated with each other when they're added to Tab Group after initial render.
