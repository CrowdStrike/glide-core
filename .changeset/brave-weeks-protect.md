'@crowdstrike/glide-core': minor
---

We've adopted the latest iteration of Dark Mode in all of our components and styles including:

- Accordion received border and box-shadow visual adjustments.
- Checkbox received a border when hovering and a box-shadow visual adjustment.
- Dropdown's "select all" and "add" functionality has been updated to use a border rather than background-color.
- Menu now has a lighter border around the popover to match Dropdown.
- Consumers previously using `--glide-core-surface-base-lightest` for app backgrounds should switch to `--glide-core-background-fill` instead.
