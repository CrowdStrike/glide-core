'@crowdstrike/glide-core': patch
---

- Dropdown no longer throws when its default slot contains both no options and no whitespace.
- Dropdown's "No Results Found" copy, shown when every option is hidden from filtering, has been changed to "No matching options".
- Dropdown now displays "No options available" when open and its default slot is empty.
