'@crowdstrike/glide-core': minor
---

- Tab Group's `panelElements` and `tabElements` properties have been removed.
- Tree's `slotElements` property has been removed.
- Tree Item's `slotElements` and `suffixSlotAssignedElements` properties have been removed.

These properties were used internally and undocumented.
So your code should continue to work without any changes.
