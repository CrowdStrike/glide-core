- Dropdown when filterable and multiselect now clears its input field when an option is selected.
- Dropdown now unhides previously filtered options when the `filterable` attribute is removed.
- Single-select dropdown now sets the value of its input field to the label of the selected option when the `filterable` attribute is added.
