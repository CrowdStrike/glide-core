'@crowdstrike/glide-core': patch

Added a Popover component.

Popover, unlike an upcoming version of Tooltip, allows for arbitrary content.
It also has a distinct visual design, opens on click instead of hover, and doesn't support a `shortcut` attribute.
Check with Design if you're unsure which component to use.
