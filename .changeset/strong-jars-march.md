- Checkbox Group's `value` property is no longer read-only.
- Checkbox Group now updates its `value` when the `value` of an underlying Checkbox has changed.
- The order of the values in Dropdown's `value` array no longer changes when the `value` of a selected Dropdown Option is changed programmatically.
