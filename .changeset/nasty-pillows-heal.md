'@crowdstrike/glide-core': patch
---

Added a Select component. Select is like Menu but as a form control. Select has `name` and `value` attributes, and it supports form control methods like `reportValidity()` and `setValidity()`.

Select does not support Form Controls Layout or multiselection. Multiselection support is coming soon.
