'@crowdstrike/glide-core': patch
---

- Disabled Radio Group Radios that are checked no longer appear checked visually or to screenreaders so it's clear to the user what will be submitted with the form.
- If multiple Radio Group Radios are checked, only the last now appears checked visually and to screenreaders so it's clear to the user what will be submitted with the form.
- If multiple Radio Group Radios are checked, only the last is now tabbable.
